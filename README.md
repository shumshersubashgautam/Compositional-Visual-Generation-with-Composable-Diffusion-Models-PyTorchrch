# Compositional-Visual-Generation-with-Composable-Diffusion-Models-PyTorchrch
conjunction and negation (negative prompts) operators for compositional generation with conditional diffusion models (i.e., Stable Diffusion, Point-E, etc).
Samples generated by Stable-Diffusion using our compositional generation operator.
More discussions and results about our proposed methods can be found in Reddit Post 1, Reddit Post 2 and Reddit Post 3!
Some prompts are borrowed from Lexica!
Dataset
Training datasets for both CLEVR Objects and CLEVR Relations will be downloaded automatically when running the script above.
